\title{Calculates local segregation indices}
\usage{
mutual_local(data, unit, group, weight = NULL, se = FALSE,
  n_bootstrap = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{unit}{A categorical variable or a vector of variables
contained in \code{data}. Defines the dimension
over which segregation is computed.}

\item{group}{A categorical variable or a vector of variables
contained in \code{data}. Defines the group for which local
segregation indices are calculated.}

\item{weight}{Numeric. Only frequency weights are allowed.
(Default \code{NULL})}

\item{se}{If \code{TRUE}, standard errors are estimated via bootstrap.
(Default \code{FALSE})}

\item{n_bootstrap}{Number of bootstrap iterations. (Default \code{10})}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with three rows for each category defined by \code{group},
  for a total of \code{3*(number of groups)} rows. The column \code{est} defines three statistics that
  are provided for each group: \code{ls}, the local segregation score,
  \code{p}, the proportion of the group from the total number of cases, and
  \code{M_group}, the product of \code{ls} and \code{p}.
  If \code{se} is set to \code{TRUE}, an additional column \code{se} contains
  the associated bootstrapped standard errors, and the column \code{est} contains
  bootstrapped estimates.
}
\description{
Returns local segregation indices for each category defined
by \code{group}.

\examples{
# which racial groups are most segregated?
(localseg = mutual_local(schools00, "school", "race", weight="n"))
# native americans are most segregated, whites are least segregated.

sum(localseg[localseg["stat"]=="p", "est"]) # => 1

# the sum of the weighted local segregation scores equals
# total segregation
mutual_total(schools00, "school", "race", weight="n") # => .425
sum(localseg[localseg["stat"]=="M_group", "est"]) # => .425
